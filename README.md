# Airbnb-data-analysis-NYC
This is my data analysis project of Airbnb listings in New York City. The data of the listings, as well as the geojson data, can be found in http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.

The goals of this project are the following:
<ol>
<li> Analyzing the data quantitatively per neighborhood, borough, amenities, etc, showing how many listings are in each of category and also the average price
<li> Studying the correlation between the different features and the price of the listing
<li> Analyzing the description of the listings, highlighting the relationships between specific keywords and the price/neighboorhood/size of the listing. One example is the word "cozy": what are the average size and price when such word appears in the description? Same goes for the word "luxurious"/"luxury"
<li> Plot some wordclouds plots to see which are the most common words in the description of the listings for each borough
<li> Plot some choropleth maps realted to the price/amount of listings per neighborhood
<li> In the second part of the project, we use some machine learning models to estimate the price of a listing given its features (location, neighboorhood, amenities, size, etc)
<ol\>
